# IU-Bus-Service-Route-Optimization-Project
Code and Project Report for Indiana University Bus Route Optimization Project 

1. Calculated average variance in scheduled arrival time of an instance of a route .
2. Found out effect of weather on average load time, passenger count and average travel time.
3. Determined average travel time between any two stops at any time of the day.
4. Calculated utilization of bus stops at any given time on any given day of the week.
5. Maximize the on-route time with sporadic breaks and optimize for most passengers carried while maintaining a minimum frequency.
